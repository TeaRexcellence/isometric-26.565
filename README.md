A lightweight JavaScript library written in TypeScript to create isometric projections using SVGs.

This is a fork of https://github.com/elchininet/isometric. It has been updated to achieve an isometric perspective of 26.565 degrees (arctangent of 0.5). Matching the exact perspective used in popular games like Diablo III, SimCity 2000, Starcraft, Habbo Hotel, etc.

I made this for myself and is not something im sure ill keep updated for public. Would love to see perspective options available in the main library. Much love to @elchininet for the amazing start to my fun block project!

It also now supports windows for the clean/finish scripts.
